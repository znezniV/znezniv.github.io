For our final bachelor project, we are having a two weeks thesis seminar which includes defining the topic, writing a mini thesis and even do some prototyping. 

## 07.01.2018 – Kick-off and Exercise I

### Introduction
At first we were introduced to the schedule and expectations of the following two weeks. The first week is meant to be used for finding and defining the topic very well. It needs to be narrowed down and meaningful.

Since this seminar gives us study points, it needs to be graded and thus requires deliverables and expectations.

We also were introduced to the meaning of a pretotype. It is a very early stage prototype which doesn't work and maybe only manifestation of an idea such as a mockup.

### Topic in One Sentence
After the information about the course, we were asked to formulated a single sentence to describe our intended work. A shock ran through our class but actually it wasn't a big issue for most of us.

My sentence was following:
> "I want to help people to imagine a political system in a post wage-work society which enhances and supports democracy."

That maybe sounds like clear intent but actually that is not really the case. But I am eager to find that out in the following days.

Also it was interesting to hear the topics of the class and how they evolved during the Christmas break. Also it felt like there were couples of very close topics which is great. From my perspective I would also wish to have a project partner but I am not sure how to get there yet.

### 20 Descriptions
For the next exercise we were asked to make twenty descriptions of our project on post-its. That was quite hard and I cheated by adding decorative post-its to my board. Also, I was not really sure if I did the exercise as intended because I just tried to describe it as I know it and just with a very few projects.

### Exercise I
For the rest of the afternoon and the following day, we started to work on the first bigger exercise. At first it seems pretty simple. We should define parameters on two or even three axis and create a matrix out of that. We then fill this matrix with related projects.

That was difficult that day but I think that there will definitely will follow some the next day.

## 08.01.2018 – Exercise I, Design Space
I have to admit that I underestimated this day and it was pretty harsh.

I continued the work of the previous day to work on the topic space. It somehow felt pretty hard because I could not find related projects. Also I had trouble to define the axis of the matrix but agreed on "applied" to "theoretic" on the x-axis and "local" to "global" on the y-axis. In particular, I was not happy with the x-axis but that's something I can change really quickly.

As Karmen promised, I took the chance to have an individual discussion with her. I also tried to briefly analyze why I was having trouble working on the topic map. In my opinion it was because I am not really good in finding related work but through the discussion, Karmen said that it could be that my topic is to broad. She said that since it is a speculative topic, I first need to write a framework of my world how I imagine it and what is reality there. Not very much into detail but narrowed down to the real thing.

To be honest that really confused me and I had a lot of trouble continue the work. May the next day be better. 

## 09.01.2018 – Finish Exercise I, Start Exercise II Design Space
As mentioned, the previous day was pretty hard. But I had the chance to talk early in the morning to Joëlle and she helped me a little to re-define the axis with me.

So on the y-axis was from "Free From Wage Work (UBI)" to "Autonomous System (Tech)" and the x-axis from "Empower Citizen" to "Optimistic". Those are things that are important for me and my future project. To the optimistic part I need to add that it shouldn't be naive optimistic. In my interpretation, optimistic can be also critical. But currently, politics seems more about to be fixing problems, surviving and not destroy everything. To really change something bigger there is a common optimism on an idea needed. 

This made it much easier to look for related work where I spent some more time on.

But soon, I started with the second exercise; the design space. The idea was to add 50 own ideas of project. I continued with the current flow and just writing down trash but ended up with not much great stuff.  

## 10.01.2018
This day we had time to continue to do some research and to work on the topic we want to focus on. I used the time to talk with my co-students to see their topic and to give and receive some feedback from then. 

Nevertheless, I had big problems continuing to work and I was kind of blocked. Everybody had a 15 minutes mentoring with Joëlle planed, and to analyze why I was blocked I tried to write it down.

I had three directions, I wasn't really sure if I should combine them. Automatized government, hobbyist politicians, and none-naive optimistic future thinking.
Also I had the feeling, that I need to narrow down the topic which would help me to know where to look more specifically.

The mentoring with Joëlle could have been much more productive because I did not have specific questions to ask. I was also not really comfortable enough to talk about it freely which was an ongoing process during the week. This is normal. However, it is not very productive and won't change a lot or bring me out of this situation. 

Nevertheless, the mentoring was not completely useless. Every talk pushes you to be more precise and think about different stuff. Also it gave a little bit more confidence that this topic is quite relevant. I just do not know from which side I need to tackle this. Joëlle reminded me how user and field studies were often successful for me in recent projects. It can guide a lot in finding a direction. 

To get some other thought, I baked a cake and made five kilos of hummus because the next day will be a special one for me.

## 11.01.2018
Doe my cake delivery, I was a little delayed in class but it also was a good excuse. In the class, Joëlle already began to explain the next and fourth exercise "10 ways of manifestation". Basically, in which form we are going to display our experience of the bachelor project. Again, this was more of a brainstorming thing in which I think I'm not good at and this doesn't help a lot either.

In one hour, I really made ten different manifestations which some I did not like. But my favorite was a Tamagotchi for politics where some people have to take care of a political department in a hobbyist way. In my vision of the last week, I painted a future with an implementation of the universal basic income where most of the state and government is automatized as well as the economy and people take place in ethical positions. If mandatory or not, people should be able to participate as hobbyist politicians in a way. This time with a Tamagotchi.

Later in the day, we were asked to make a plan of the following final week were we should make a so called pretotype, field research and a presentation of our pretotype. 
It definitely would make sense for me to talk with other people to get a little out of my head. So I planed an interview.

More details on the plan of the final week will follow.
