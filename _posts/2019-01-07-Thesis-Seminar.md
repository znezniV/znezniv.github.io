For our final bachelor project, we are having a two weeks thesis seminar which includes defining the topic, writing a mini thesis and even do some prototyping. 

## 07.01.2018 – Kick-off and Exercise I

### Introduction
At first we were introduced to the schedule and expectations of the following two weeks. The first week is meant to be used for finding and defining the topic very well. It needs to be narrowed down and meaningful.

Since this seminar gives us study points, it needs to be graded and thus requires deliverables and expectations.

We also were introduced to the meaning of a pretotype. It is a very early stage prototype which doesn't work and maybe only manifestation of an idea such as a mockup.

### Topic in One Sentence
After the information about the course, we were asked to formulated a single sentence to describe our intended work. A shock ran through our class but actually it wasn't a big issue for most of us.

My sentence was following:
> "I want to help people to imagine a political system in a post wage-work society which enhances and supports democracy."

That maybe sounds like clear intent but actually that is not really the case. But I am eager to find that out in the following days.

Also it was interesting to hear the topics of the class and how they evolved during the Christmas break. Also it felt like there were couples of very close topics which is great. From my perspective I would also wish to have a project partner but I am not sure how to get there yet.

### 20 Descriptions
For the next exercise we were asked to make twenty descriptions of our project on post-its. That was quite hard and I cheated by adding decorative post-its to my board. Also, I was not really sure if I did the exercise as intended because I just tried to describe it as I know it and just with a very few projects.

### Exercise I
For the rest of the afternoon and the following day, we started to work on the first bigger exercise. At first it seems pretty simple. We should define parameters on two or even three axis and create a matrix out of that. We then fill this matrix with related projects.

That was difficult that day but I think that there will definitely will follow some the next day.

## 08.01.2018 – Exercise I, Design Space
I have to admit that I underestimated this day and it was pretty harsh.

I continued the work of the previous day to work on the topic space. It somehow felt pretty hard because I could not find related projects. Also I had trouble to define the axis of the matrix but agreed on "applied" to "theoretic" on the x-axis and "local" to "global" on the y-axis. In particular, I was not happy with the x-axis but that's something I can change really quickly.

As Karmen promised, I took the chance to have an individual discussion with her. I also tried to briefly analyze why I was having trouble working on the topic map. In my opinion it was because I am not really good in finding related work but through the discussion, Karmen said that it could be that my topic is to broad. She said that since it is a speculative topic, I first need to write a framework of my world how I imagine it and what is reality there. Not very much into detail but narrowed down to the real thing.

To be honest that really confused me and I had a lot of trouble continue the work. May the next day be better.
