For our final bachelor project, we are having a two weeks thesis seminar which includes defining the topic, writing a mini thesis and even do some prototyping. 

## 07.01.2018 â€“ Kick-off and Exercise I

### Introduction
At first we were introduced to the schedule and expectations of the following two weeks. The first week is meant to be used for finding and defining the topic very well. It needs to be narrowed down and meaningful.

Since this seminar gives us study points, it needs to be graded and thus requires deliverables and expectations.

We also were introduced to the meaning of a pretotype. It is a very early stage prototype which doesn't work and maybe only manifestation of an idea such as a mockup.

### Topic in One Sentence
After the information about the course, we were asked to formulated a single sentence to describe our intended work. A shock ran through our class but actually it wasn't a big issue for most of us.

My sentence was following:
> "I want to help people to imagine a political system in a post wage-work society which enhances and supports democracy."

That maybe sounds like clear intent but actually that is not really the case. But I am eager to find that out in the following days.

Also it was interesting to hear the topics of the class and how they evolved during the Christmas break. Also it felt like there were couples of very close topics which is great. From my perspective I would also wish to have a project partner but I am not sure how to get there yet.

### 20 Descriptions
For the next exercise we were asked to make twenty descriptions of our project on post-its. That was quite hard and I cheated by adding decorative post-its to my board. Also, I was not really sure if I did the exercise as intended because I just tried to describe it as I know it and just with a very few projects.

Other Projects in related field from left to right. Cyberfolk (included into Project Cybersyn supervised by Stafford Beer in Chile during Allende goverment in 1971), control room of Project Cybersyn, self-invented radical plattform to vote for everything.

### Exercise I
For the rest of the afternoon and the following day, we started to work on the first bigger exercise. At first it seems pretty simple. We should define parameters on two or even three axis and create a matrix out of that. We then fill this matrix with related projects.

That was difficult that day but I think that there will definitely will follow some the next day.
