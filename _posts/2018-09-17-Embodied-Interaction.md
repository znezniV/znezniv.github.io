desc: A journal about the "Embodied Interaction" module at Zurich University of Arts
---

This post is a journal for the module “Embodied Interaction” at Zurich University of Arts in the fifth semester of the Interaction Design course.

## 17.09. Monday – Kick-Off
As most modules, our docents began with a short kick-off for the whole module where we were introduced to the overall topic and received all necessary information for the following five weeks.

### Mini Exercise
To begin, our teacher Joëlle introduced a small challenge for the next 24h. The assignment was to track data or traces from our body in an analogue way. This should help us to get a little into the topic and make some more thoughts about it.

I found my topic really quickly because I was fascinated a lot by the field of skin conductance, more precisely [Electrodermal activity, short EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_conductance).

Actually it's quite a simple thing. If we get stressed (generally), we tend to sweat on our fingers. This can be easily  measured by the change of conductivity on the skin caused by the sweat.
The fascinating thing is, that this can change within seconds so correlations can be easily made. On the other hand, this also makes it hard to interpret it since our body is so sensitive. At least it's very hard to control by the body and often times driven by emotions we feel. Also, it is technically relatively easy to measure.

This sensor is – in combination with other sensors – is used in falsely called lie detectors. But since these sensors only show discomfort or kind of stress, it's not really possible to completely identify a lie and so this machine shouldn't be called like that.

To measure my sweaty fingers, I decided to draw a spot with a soft pencil in my notebook, put my thumb and my index finger on it and drag smear my finger down to the page. With the gradient of the track I was able to see how wet my fingers were.

I repeated that after sitting on the atelier terrace, after the bike ride, while cooking, while eating spicy food and after doing dishes. Instead of doing it on a fixed timescale, I wanted to examine some certain events. 

The actual thing that interested me was the effect from my body on my fingers but after washing the dishes (and drying my hand) my fingers obviously were very dry. This is more an effect from outside directly on my fingers and not through my body and brain. But I also continue to observe these things.

## 17.09. Tuesday – Introduction in the topic
I continued with my data tracking after I woke up and when I drove to school, back home (because I forgot my notebook) and back to school (I've been really sweaty, not only on my fingers).

In school, we presented our work an received a little bit of feedback by our teacher Joëlle.

### Methodology, case studies
Also Joëlle made a very interesting presentation about methodologies and case studies. The methodology included datagraphy, personal data that could be gathered (body data, physiological data, life stats, network based data and admin data).

#### Taxonomy
Also, she introduced us to taxonomy of digitally fabricated data outputs. I think this helps us a lot to not get completely lost in this field which still if fairly new to us.
- Data Sculptures
- Form Chasers
- Fixture as Structures (metaphor for expressions i.e. sofa -> brain waves)
- Performers (Interactive, music from answers)
- Mavericks (machines that are different i.e. satellite path on card)
- Body as interface

#### Methods
Following ways to translate data into a representation:
1. XYZ translation (into 3D space)
2. Metapher as data
3. Existing grammar
4. (unreadable on my notes)
5. Purpose driven

## 17.09. Wednesday – Bodystorming and Inspiration
### Single performance
This morning started with a small assignment that was given to us in the previous day. The idea was to make a short performance of approximately three minutes to display our analogue data we collected. It was a very funny and still interesting start and sometimes we couldn't hold it back to laugh very hard.

I decided to represent the data with sound. So, I took the OP-1 pocket synthesizer (which helps me in all situations) with me, chose a synthesizer and pitch, and mapped a single note on a step built in step sequenzer to make sure the note is always played with the same length. I translated the gradient I had in my notebook from putting my finger on the pencil spot from the previous in decay of the note I played. Therefore I went back into synthesizer mode and mapped the decay of the sound to the gradient I perceived and mentioned the event I was recording my sweat on the fingers, such as while cooking, after cycling and so on.
It maybe wasn't a "productive" exercise but still it helped me to gently get into the topic. 

I think the fascination about data is more that it could give us accurate, un-biased and objective insides when we do not even have to think about it. These advantages are usually not here in the analogue way. But especially because these measurements are biased, it helps (in my opinion) much more to be aware of what we are measuring and the overall situation. It doesn't tempt us to focus to much on every detail and this is especially helpful in the beginning. 

### Performance about another person
After our personal performance we were asked to form groups to observe the traces / data a group partner leaves and make a little performance afterwards again. 

Dani and decided to do that together and spend lunch time to observe each other. We found a few ticks about each other but we were not really satisfied by this idea. After a while we met a girl which was having her second day at Cast (audiovisual media)  who introduced herself very friendly but also in a weird way. We noticed how hard and awkward these situations can be so we decided to make a performance as if we meet each other the first time.
Included was an awkward asking for the right room, the question what we are studying and a weird hand shake / clap / hug.

### Research Verena Ziegler
Verena Ziegler introduced us to her research which changed from architecture to "interactive" fabrics, all with new digitally fabricated technologies.

Along that she has shown us tons of great inspiration in the field of embodied fabrication.

List:
- "Walking City", Archigram, 1960
- "Body Extension", Lydia Clark, 60s
- "Cool Himmelblau", 1971
- "Finger Glover" / "Einhorn", Rebecca Horn, 1970
- "Mobile Office", Hane Holler, 1969
- Lucy McRae
- Iris van Herpen
- "Shrink", Lawrence Malstrat
- James Merry (Björn)
- Nero Oxman

### Data output repetion
After our brains were completely blown away by the projects that have been done our docent Joëlle made some repetition.
It included:
- Metapher
- Data mapping
	- XYZ Mapping
- Existing grammar
- Machine Properties
- Purpose driven design
- Data driven design.

This should prepare us for the following brainstorm session.

### Brainstorming
Since I'm not such a fan of brainstorms I tried to make something different. I knew that we were making a speed dating brainstorm and from my previous experience I knew that sometimes it isn't working with every person. So instead of pressuring me, I accepted that sometimes I had no idea but I asked questions to my brainstorm partner to challenge them for some ideas.

After all, we found some pretty interesting ideas which we all collected in front of the class and briefly discussed.

### Afterwork
The goal of the day was to build groups and find a direction of the topic we want to focus on. During the brainstorming sessions Daniel Holler and me had a great flow so we decided to go further on our ideas. After a ping pong session we agreed to focus on sweat and do some general research what sweat can mean in society.
