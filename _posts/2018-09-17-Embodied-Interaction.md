desc: A journal about the "Embodied Interaction" module at Zurich University of Arts

This post is a journal for the module “Embodied Interaction” at Zurich University of Arts in the fifth semester of the Interaction Design course.

## 17.09. Monday – Kick-Off
As most modules, our docents began with a short kick-off for the whole module where we were introduced to the overall topic and received all necessary information for the following five weeks.

### Mini Exercise
To begin, our teacher Joëlle introduced a small challenge for the next 24h. The assignment was to track data or traces from our body in an analogue way. This should help us to get a little into the topic and make some more thoughts about it.

I found my topic really quickly because I was fascinated a lot by the field of skin conductance, more precisely [Electrodermal activity, short EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_conductance).

Actually it's quite a simple thing. If we get stressed (generally), we tend to sweat on our fingers. This can be easily  measured by the change of conductivity on the skin caused by the sweat.
The fascinating thing is, that this can change within seconds so correlations can be easily made. On the other hand, this also makes it hard to interpret it since our body is so sensitive. At least it's very hard to control by the body and often times driven by emotions we feel. Also, it is technically relatively easy to measure.

This sensor is – in combination with other sensors – is used in falsely called lie detectors. But since these sensors only show discomfort or kind of stress, it's not really possible to completely identify a lie and so this machine shouldn't be called like that.

To measure my sweaty fingers, I decided to draw a spot with a soft pencil in my notebook, put my thumb and my index finger on it and drag smear my finger down to the page. With the gradient of the track I was able to see how wet my fingers were.

I repeated that after sitting on the atelier terrace, after the bike ride, while cooking, while eating spicy food and after doing dishes. Instead of doing it on a fixed timescale, I wanted to examine some certain events. 

The actual thing that interested me was the effect from my body on my fingers but after washing the dishes (and drying my hand) my fingers obviously were very dry. This is more an effect from outside directly on my fingers and not through my body and brain. But I also continue to observe these things.

## 17.09. Tuesday – Introduction in the topic
I continued with my data tracking after I woke up and when I drove to school, back home (because I forgot my notebook) and back to school (I've been really sweaty, not only on my fingers).

In school, we presented our work an received a little bit of feedback by our teacher Joëlle.

### Methodology, case studies
Also Joëlle made a very interesting presentation about methodologies and case studies. The methodology included datagraphy, personal data that could be gathered (body data, physiological data, life stats, network based data and admin data).

#### Taxonomy
Also, she introduced us to taxonomy of digitally fabricated data outputs. I think this helps us a lot to not get completely lost in this field which still if fairly new to us.
- Data Sculptures
- Form Chasers
- Fixture as Structures (metaphor for expressions i.e. sofa -> brain waves)
- Performers (Interactive, music from answers)
- Mavericks (machines that are different i.e. satellite path on card)
- Body as interface

#### Methods
Following ways to translate data into a representation:
1. XYZ translation (into 3D space)
2. Metapher as data
3. Existing grammar
4. (unreadable on my notes)
5. Purpose driven


### Sensing and data collection
