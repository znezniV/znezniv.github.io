desc: A journal about the "Embodied Interaction" module at Zurich University of Arts
---

This post is a journal for the module “Embodied Interaction” at Zurich University of Arts in the fifth semester of the Interaction Design course.

## 17.09. Monday – Kick-Off
As most modules, our docents began with a short kick-off for the whole module where we were introduced to the overall topic and received all necessary information for the following five weeks.

### Mini Exercise
To begin, our teacher Joëlle introduced a small challenge for the next 24h. The assignment was to track data or traces from our body in an analogue way. This should help us to get a little into the topic and make some more thoughts about it.

I found my topic really quickly because I was fascinated a lot by the field of skin conductance, more precisely [Electrodermal activity, short EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_conductance).

Actually it's quite a simple thing. If we get stressed (generally), we tend to sweat on our fingers. This can be easily  measured by the change of conductivity on the skin caused by the sweat.
The fascinating thing is, that this can change within seconds so correlations can be easily made. On the other hand, this also makes it hard to interpret it since our body is so sensitive. At least it's very hard to control by the body and often times driven by emotions we feel. Also, it is technically relatively easy to measure.

This sensor is – in combination with other sensors – is used in falsely called lie detectors. But since these sensors only show discomfort or kind of stress, it's not really possible to completely identify a lie and so this machine shouldn't be called like that.

To measure my sweaty fingers, I decided to draw a spot with a soft pencil in my notebook, put my thumb and my index finger on it and drag smear my finger down to the page. With the gradient of the track I was able to see how wet my fingers were.

I repeated that after sitting on the atelier terrace, after the bike ride, while cooking, while eating spicy food and after doing dishes. Instead of doing it on a fixed timescale, I wanted to examine some certain events. 

The actual thing that interested me was the effect from my body on my fingers but after washing the dishes (and drying my hand) my fingers obviously were very dry. This is more an effect from outside directly on my fingers and not through my body and brain. But I also continue to observe these things.

## 17.09. Tuesday – Introduction in the topic
I continued with my data tracking after I woke up and when I drove to school, back home (because I forgot my notebook) and back to school (I've been really sweaty, not only on my fingers).

In school, we presented our work an received a little bit of feedback by our teacher Joëlle.

### Methodology, case studies
Also Joëlle made a very interesting presentation about methodologies and case studies. The methodology included datagraphy, personal data that could be gathered (body data, physiological data, life stats, network based data and admin data).

#### Taxonomy
Also, she introduced us to taxonomy of digitally fabricated data outputs. I think this helps us a lot to not get completely lost in this field which still if fairly new to us.
- Data Sculptures
- Form Chasers
- Fixture as Structures (metaphor for expressions i.e. sofa -> brain waves)
- Performers (Interactive, music from answers)
- Mavericks (machines that are different i.e. satellite path on card)
- Body as interface

#### Methods
Following ways to translate data into a representation:
1. XYZ translation (into 3D space)
2. Metapher as data
3. Existing grammar
4. (unreadable on my notes)
5. Purpose driven

## 18.09. Wednesday – Bodystorming and Inspiration
### Single performance
This morning started with a small assignment that was given to us in the previous day. The idea was to make a short performance of approximately three minutes to display our analogue data we collected. It was a very funny and still interesting start and sometimes we couldn't hold it back to laugh very hard.

I decided to represent the data with sound. So, I took the OP-1 pocket synthesizer (which helps me in all situations) with me, chose a synthesizer and pitch, and mapped a single note on a step built in step sequenzer to make sure the note is always played with the same length. I translated the gradient I had in my notebook from putting my finger on the pencil spot from the previous in decay of the note I played. Therefore I went back into synthesizer mode and mapped the decay of the sound to the gradient I perceived and mentioned the event I was recording my sweat on the fingers, such as while cooking, after cycling and so on.
It maybe wasn't a "productive" exercise but still it helped me to gently get into the topic. 

I think the fascination about data is more that it could give us accurate, un-biased and objective insides when we do not even have to think about it. These advantages are usually not here in the analogue way. But especially because these measurements are biased, it helps (in my opinion) much more to be aware of what we are measuring and the overall situation. It doesn't tempt us to focus to much on every detail and this is especially helpful in the beginning. 

### Performance about another person
After our personal performance we were asked to form groups to observe the traces / data a group partner leaves and make a little performance afterwards again. 

Dani and decided to do that together and spend lunch time to observe each other. We found a few ticks about each other but we were not really satisfied by this idea. After a while we met a girl which was having her second day at Cast (audiovisual media)  who introduced herself very friendly but also in a weird way. We noticed how hard and awkward these situations can be so we decided to make a performance as if we meet each other the first time.
Included was an awkward asking for the right room, the question what we are studying and a weird hand shake / clap / hug.

### Research Verena Ziegler
Verena Ziegler introduced us to her research which changed from architecture to "interactive" fabrics, all with new digitally fabricated technologies.

Along that she has shown us tons of great inspiration in the field of embodied fabrication.

List:
- "Walking City", Archigram, 1960
- "Body Extension", Lydia Clark, 60s
- "Cool Himmelblau", 1971
- "Finger Glover" / "Einhorn", Rebecca Horn, 1970
- "Mobile Office", Hane Holler, 1969
- Lucy McRae
- Iris van Herpen
- "Shrink", Lawrence Malstrat
- James Merry (Björn)
- Nero Oxman

### Data output repetion
After our brains were completely blown away by the projects that have been done our docent Joëlle made some repetition.
It included:
- Metapher
- Data mapping
	- XYZ Mapping
- Existing grammar
- Machine Properties
- Purpose driven design
- Data driven design.

This should prepare us for the following brainstorm session.

### Brainstorming
Since I'm not such a fan of brainstorms I tried to make something different. I knew that we were making a speed dating brainstorm and from my previous experience I knew that sometimes it isn't working with every person. So instead of pressuring me, I accepted that sometimes I had no idea but I asked questions to my brainstorm partner to challenge them for some ideas.

After all, we found some pretty interesting ideas which we all collected in front of the class and briefly discussed.

### Afterwork
The goal of the day was to build groups and find a direction of the topic we want to focus on. During the brainstorming sessions Daniel Holler and me had a great flow so we decided to go further on our ideas. After a ping pong session we agreed to focus on sweat and do some general research what sweat can mean in society.

## 20.09. Friday – Working on the topic
**This is a post written by my co-worker [Daniel E. Holler on his Blog](https://medium.com/@daniel.e.holler/embodied-interaction-20-09-db965c64fd75)**
The project is slowly gaining some shape and colour. On wednesday, the big performance day, we had the chance to enjoy some theatrical, didactical and funny perfromance presentations by our class mates. After having had the first contact with personal data and how we can creativley express it, we had to dig deeper in the afternoon and closley observe some ticks or little habits of strangers, and again perform it in front of the class. This lead to a more concise finding of ideas, in the form of a creative speed dating.

### The Idea
After the speed dating my idea slowly cristallized about the same subject as Vinzenz’s: We want to work with sweat. We were intrigued by its simplicity, its raw nature but especially by its very variegated purpose for humans and animals.

This morning after having made a quick research session about the subject, our ideas started flowing and flowing. From highlighting sweat and making it a (fashion) statement, to making a portable sweat diary, to having some sort of second skin where sweat could be represented.

### The Trouble
Currently we are having a little trouble to connect the dots: the measurable data, the product and the purpose. We also dove into some metaphors which are related to sweat. Quickly we found the strigil, a sort of scraping tool used by ancient greeks, in order to cleanse the skin before and after doing sport. 

### Researching


#### A typical strigil
the significance of sweating in ancient culture we found something really interesting: Sweating was regarded by many cultures spanning the whole globe as cleansing. Sweating cleansed the body psychologically and physically in a sort of ritual. This sacral importance of sweating completely lost its meaning in nowaday’s society, where sweating is regarded as something to be frowned upon.

### The Concept (?)
The current state of our very raw concept would connect a simple monitoring of when and how much a body sweats, transcribe the data into a digitally fabricated object (preferably sturdy and durbale materials) and for example wear the solidified sweat (as we all know sweat probably the most ephemeral secretion of the body). The solidified sweat would hide bodyparts but at the same time the “undesired” sweat is made visible. Furthermore we would like to connect these aspects of our concept with the metaphor of rituals, but we will start to experiment first with the sweat sensor in order to guide our concept into the right direction.

## 20.09. Friday – Rhino & Grasshopper Introduction
For 3D editing we had a day of introduction for the software [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) with the visual coding extension [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/). This should enable us to process data into parametric design models for this course.

### Drawing, Primitives, Boolean Operations and Loft
Since we already had an introduction in Rhino last year, the overview in the software was a little short. We right away jumped into the curve drawing tool which we used to draw an arrow. A handy tool is the search bar where all commands just can be typed and the command bar when the drawing tool is selected. This way you can select the starting point first (comma separated for x and y coordinates) and after pressing enter the actual length of the stroke you want to draw. The drawn curve we than extruded. To have a better view on it we changed the preview method to a version which was previewing the model in 3D instead of just lines by a right click on the camera perspective name.

Later on we just played around with primitives such as cubes, cylinders, spheres, text and pipes which was a curve combined with a circle curve. 

![Rhino Primitives]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/embodied/rhino-primitives.jpg)

Boolean operations were actually very straightforward as we know it from other graphic softwares. But there is a huge catalogue with different operators which are still to explore.

![Rhino Boolean]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/embodied/rhino-boolean.jpg)

At the and we combined two simple curves into a simple loft. This loft can be rendered with straight sections so that it could for example cut onto a flat surface which then again can be assembled into a 3D structure.

### Grasshopper
Then finally we started with Grasshopper to generate some cool stuff. First of all, we had an intro to the overall interface but it's really messy and hard to learn. The nice thing is, that a double click on the Grasshopper canvas opens up a search bar similar to the one in Rhino where elements to place can be found.

First confusing thing is that there are two different ways to draw primitives. First, draw it in Rhino and connect it to a object by right clicking on the Grasshopper element and selecting to connect an object. These Grasshopper objects have a  hexagon shape around them. Second, is to generate an object in Grasshopper and this is just done by adding the same kind of element but without the hexagon.

#### Generate and Divide Loft from Three Points
Later in Rhino we drew three points and connected them with Rhino (select multiple points) draw a line between them which then were generated into a plane which we divided into two numbers (chosen by a number slider) into parts (with "Divide Domain^2") and then created a box out of them with "Isotrim" and "Surface Box" where the height was controlled by a slider again.

![Grasshopper Divided Loft]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/embodied/grasshopper-divided-loft.jpg)

Going on with the previous work, we draw a so called "Bounding Box" which contained a sphere which was subtracting it from the box. This "Bounding Box" then was added into every section we previously divided from the loft. I did not really get how we made this but I guess that's fine.

#### Pipe Curves
The next one was much easier to grasp. We drew two curves, divided them into points and connected these points with a curve. A pipe then let these lines look much cooler.

![Grasshopper Pipe Curve]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/embodied/grasshopper-pipe-curves.jpg)

These pipes then can be shifted by a certain factor.

#### Working With a Face
To finish all up, we scanned a classmates face with the software "Skanect" and then continued to modify it with Grasshopper.

The scan was built up with a polygon structure which is widely used by many 3D tools. Each polygon has three points which we separated using list item and an index for each list item. The function "InCircle" finds the inner center of three points where we generated an area inside and extruded it to a certain amount and closed by the function "Cap Holes". Then we scaled X Y and Z coordinates and we had a cool kind of parametric work on a scanned human body part.
