## Related Work
Today, I started to read some more into related projects we have found in the days before to understand the projects more and to maybe find something related as well.

The meme was transformed into an inside-joke in graphic design work which was only visible for people that are able to trace it back to the original meaning. This can be seen as a form of protest at work were people trick a way to fool their bosses at work.
